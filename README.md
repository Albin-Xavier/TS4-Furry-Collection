# TS4-Furry-Collection
Adds wolf patterns as well as a GSD pattern for [Savestate's Furry Mod](http://www.savestatecomic.com/dlc/).

## Installation
Place the .package into \*Documents Folder\*/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Make sure you have mods enabled in The Sims 4. All of the patterns can be found in-game under the Tattoos category.

## Editing
All the mod files are simply png files. As such they can be edited by any image editor. After editing the png texture, use [Sims 4 Studio](https://sims4studio.com/board/31/downloading-installing-sims-4-studio) to inject the png textures into the .package file.
