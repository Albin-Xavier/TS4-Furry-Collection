## :monocle_face: About <a name = "about"></a>
Adds wolf patterns as well as a GSD pattern for [Savestate's Furry Mod](http://www.savestatecomic.com/dlc/).\
Also available on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/thesims4/mods/1181)\

## :checkered_flag: Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get the mod set up in your game, for either in-game use or for making edits/contributions.

### Installing
Place the .package into \*Documents Folder\*/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods. Make sure you have mods enabled in The Sims 4. All of the patterns can be found in-game under the Tattoos category.

### Contributing
All the mod files are simply png files. As such they can be edited by any image editor. After editing the png texture, use [Sims 4 Studio](https://sims4studio.com/board/31/downloading-installing-sims-4-studio) to inject the png textures into the .package file.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Additional screenshots for the media category are accepted, but please format them as .jpg images, or provide a link to another image host, such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).
